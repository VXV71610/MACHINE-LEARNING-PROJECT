Abstract: The diagnosis and prognosis of heart-related diseases require greater accuracy, perfection, and correctness because even a minor error can result in exhaustion or even death. Heart-related deaths are common, and the number of these deaths is rising rapidly every day. According to a new WHO report, cardiac problems are becoming more prevalent. It ranks among the world's major causes of death. One person loses their life owing to heart disease every minute in today's everyday modern life, making heart disease deaths one of the primary problems. The ability to predict the onset of disease at an early stage is extremely difficult nowadays. It becomes more challenging to diagnose and begin treatment at an early stage as the population grows. However, as a result of recent technological advancements, machine-learning approaches have propelled numerous studies in the health industry. Building an ML model for predicting heart disease based on the factors is the goal of this paper. When used in the healthcare industry, machine learning has the potential to diagnose diseases accurately and early. The circumstances of heart disease that may arise are calculated in this work. Medical parameters are characteristics of the datasets used. The construction of the model has made use of machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. With the aid of conventional machine learning techniques, we also attempted to identify connections between the various dataset variables in order to effectively forecast the likelihood of developing heart disease. The results demonstrate that Logistic Regression provides greater prediction accuracy in less time than other ML approaches.
